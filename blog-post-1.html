                          <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my first post!</p><p>My name is Konstantina Sokratous and I am beginning my 5th year of Ph.D. at the University of Florida. I am also expected to be an incoming Visiting Scholar at the OSU for the academic year 2024-2025. But that's all pending (!!!) and if you wonder pending what, well the answer is US Immigration. This post will be made public in a few weeks </p>

                          </blockquote>

                          <p> <!--- You might ask why my first post on my academic/professional website involves a post that has very little to do with my skills or direct research. Well, in a way you're right, it has nothing to do with it but in another way, it has everything to do about it.
                          To offer some context, I began my PhD program in August 2020. In my first letter of admission, I received evidently confirmation of my admission to the program but also a confirmation that my funding was going to be warrantied for 5 years, as the PhD program at UF is traditionally 5 years long. Ok, so nothing new here, I was anyway told during the interview that if I wanted to do my PhD at UF, then I needed to stay for 5 years instead of 4, even if I were to transfer either one of my master's degrees.

                          <br> 
                          One thus might think that it is only logical that the University will produce a document that would allow me to get (or allow the embassy to issue) a VISA for 5 years, right? Rightttt? Well no! And I certainly cannot speak as to whether this lack of logic is universal to the US academic system or simply to the very problematic state of Florida, but at the end of the day they issued me a 4-year I-20, stating that the expected end of my program is summer of 2024, when they had in fact imposed the 5 year schedule themselves.
                          Ok and so what? You can get issued a new I-20 and then apply for a renewal. It is a seemless process they said. An administrative formality they said. Well surprise, surprise, whatever they said was pure bullshit. </p>

                          <p>It turns out that the visa renewal process is not easy at all, quite the contrary and I am here to give international students some information that I wish I had going into this. First of all, if you find yourself in a position of having to renew your visa throughout your PhD, my serious advice is to not leave the US to go renew it. In my case I had only one year of PhD left, so had I known how complicated and stressful the renewal was, I would have stayed in the US.
                          When I went to renew, I passed the interview and was told my visa was approved. Upon paying the reciprocity fee, I returned to the window of the officer who had my passport, only now to find 2 people there. They very empathetically told me that while they approved my visa, I got flagged by system. So instead of receiving a green or red (no idea what they meant by this), my application got a yellow suggesting that there was a need for further processing. 
                          When I asked why I got flagged, I was told that the embassy has no idea and cannot see the reason, as the concern was not generated by them but rather by the system. I pressed for more questions and was simply told that they now have an AI checking things and it takes your phone number and name checks also different databases, raising concerns accordingly. <br> 

                          I am therefore told to leave my passport there (mistake), send them an email when I'm closer to my fly out date back to the US and that the only thing I can do is wait. Could take 2 days or 2 months... In matters of seconds, I probably went through the entire emotional spectrum. I now had to wait for some bureaucrat in Washington to formally check the concerned aspects of my application. Needless to say that if the reason you got flagged somehow involves more than one agency, then good luck ever getting out of Administrative Processing. 
                          I leave the embassy heartbroken and drive 2 hours back to my hometown in a state shock. As I start looking for information online, I find out that this happens if your name matches let's say the name of someone in a cartel or terrorism database. I strongly doubt that there is a terrorist or cartel member somewhere with the name Konstantina Sokratous.
                          This might also be happening because of suspicion for human trafficking, criminal record, child abuse etc. The list is long but vastly absurd, except for 2 points. The first is the TAL, a list that includes topics of research that require further processing. I never knew anything about TAL, but on that list Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition are included.  
                          <br> 

                          Ok could this be that I am going through all this because I do research in AI ? No way! My I20 says General Psychology - a discriminatory practice from the University of Florida to prevent internationals to get access to STEM OPT, meaning the ability to stay 2 years past graduation in the US instead of 1. Plus, no one asked me at the embassy my topic of research, so how would they know?
                          If they are that serious about this topic, to the point where they keep databased and lists to flag people that work in AI, then this would happen more often. But as I came to find out through the web this almost never happens to people from european countries. I could not find a testimony of a single european online who had gone through Administrative Processing.
                          It's sad how biased it is, but at the same time if it never happens to europeans then why did it happen to me? And if this is for AI research then why does it not happen to everyone? So maybe it's not the AI thing, maybe it's something else. 
                          
                          <br> 
                          I spent days compulsively thinking about every single thing I did in the US. Thinking about every single mistake in the last 4 years or act that could be somehow interpreted as a mistake by the immigration services. The thing is, if my visa gets approved, I will never know why this happened. And if it gets rejected, I will know very little. But the mere idea that I somehow did something to jeopardise my future and 2 semesters before graduation I get denied a visa, has plunged me emotionally. 
                          Not to mention I was in the process of moving. My car is in Florida, my furniture in a warehouse in Ohio, my lease signed and starting soon in Columbus, my car titles at the DMV of Florida, my money in my US accounts. Just the idea that they could tell me tomorrow "Sorry sis you cant go back" just slightly drives me crazy.
                          I'm also supposed to be applying for jobs and postdocs. I have 2 first author papers almost ready to get submitted, 1 review pending for another, a dissertation to finish and defend, multiple new projects to start or continue. This is the worst time for me to be down, but I am. 

                          <br> 
                          The only thing I can think of, is that they might come back to me with immigrant intent. This is a nebulous premise the immigration makes to say that somehow you have displayed an intent to move to the US, as such often they will use this as an excuse to deny visas. Because apparently, the premise of an F1 is to study and then go back to your home country, thus if you say in an interview "I'd love to eventually move to the US", even if you plan to do it in the most legal way possible,
                          your visa will be denied. This is something I came to find out once I was in AP. So anything you do in the US during your time there, can be used against you during renewal - makes sense for serious things but they will use anything, even the smallest things - and you might have to find yourself having to justify "lack of intent". Good luck proving lack of something, lack of anything, prooving non existence. Whoever manages that, shall receive a nobel prize. 
                          I also didn't know that they would use my phone number to conduct checks. Had I known, I would have used my home country phone number for visa purposes. Maybe at the end it would not have changed a thing, since they could still see in the system my name associated with that number or my social security, but still. I wish I had all this information before hand, so I could be more cautious during the renewal process.
                          I also wish I had known how bad the renewal can be and the associated risks, because had I known, I would have pushed UF for a 5 year I20 to avoid said renewal. None of this would have happened if the University of Florida issued truthful documents. They marked my start date summer 2020 and end date summer 2024, so the immigration could only issue a visa for that period. But that was a lie. My program would have never finished in 2024, there is no single person at the department who does their PhD in 4 years unless they have a very specific
                          agreement with their advisor. There are over 100 graduate students, I know none that has graduated or is on a schedule to graduate in 4 years. The university wants all the cheap labor they can get, if anything the department is widely known for funding 6th year students and a lot of people finish late not early (relative to the standard). So why issue a 4 year I20?
                          Why force students to go through renewal when they know this happens and there are such risks? Because they do know! As I found out, they know very well a lot of students would go through this hardle and get stuck and even get unable to go back. 

                          <br> 
                          They need to justify their actions and I wish I was still in the graduate union to get them riled up and demand a meeting. They must be held accountable for their discriminatory if not racist approach. But at the end of day, I'm sure nothing will change, at least not radically. Not while we're seen
                          as disposable objects that serve a specific purpose, instead of human beings. The best we can do as international students is to inform ourselves prior to moving there, to be best prepared. Knowing about TAL, failure to demonstrate ties to home country,
                          immigrant intent, administrative processing, visa renewal hardles etc could help future international students make more strategic choices for their own interest. I made a promise to myself to try and diffuse information about this as much as possible. Fight for more 
                          transparency from the university and the departments. Not sure I will succeed, but I'm sure as hell I'll try. -->
