                    <p class="text-justify">I think this can easily become a whole career topic for someone, I just haven't decided whether I want it to be mine. Partly because it is an extremely intricate topic. What is time?
                        How do we perceive it ? How does it affect - if not give rise - to our behavior ? I am certain - and I say this with the naivete of a grad student - that a generalised theory and a robust model of subjective timing will be able to
                        explain and predict behavior better than individual models of phenomena. But anyway, I digress, my work on this topic so far has been mostly tipping my toes into the timing literature and paradigms. All behavior is dynamic, all perception is dynamic, everything
                        exists and gets processed in the brain dynamically. So then it does not make sense to try and understand people's behavior in segregated snapshots or timestamps because it can never situate people along a continuum of behavior. Again, I digress... never ending problem for me... 
                        
                        THIS WORK, focuses on simply testing people's behavior on paradigms that extend past reactive tasks. Most of the experimental literature involves exposing an individual to some rapid stimulus with the aim to explore how the participant reacts to said stimulus.
                        While this approach has its merit for many reasons and topics, it remains very detached from the reality of everyday life. A lot of what we do in our lives involves planning and thinking ahead about upcoming events even at the most basic level.
                        For instance, when should I leave the house to arrive at X location by XYZ time. Or given my current speed and distance from the traffic light, should I speed up and make it past the orange light or should I slow down and stop ? Some people are just better than this, think about your 
                        favorite athlete and how she/he can estimate the time and location of a flying object (ie catching a ball) with absolute precision vs your friend that you will look straight into the eyes, say "CATCH" and they will still stand there as the flying object hits them in the face (test ran this many times with my siblings..).
                        So what I am (very slowly) trying to get at is the reality of our substantial individual differences when it comes to timing estimates, judgements, and planning. I believe that understanding these differences at a fundamental level will unlock answers for many other types of behavior, both typical and atypical.

                        For example, we know that time compresses and expands in certain ways based on the way we feel. Research suggests that people with depression experience the passage of time as slower and IF we can trust these findings (nuance into depression, passage of time etc), then we can understand why 
                        people with depression often report a feeling of exhaustion. If 8 hours of objective clock time are experienced biologically as 10, then that could potentially explain other types of observed behavior and symptoms. So what if individual differences in time perception/judgements could explain differences in behaviors
                        such as delay discounting/delay sensitivity and procrastination behavior, which in turn can influence other behaviors and judgements? What if there was a way to link it all ?

                        So is this what this project is about ? NO. I wish... it's actually just a starting point into what we can observe in terms of individual behavior on a whole different range of tasks such as anticipatory judgements. What if we tell people to expect an event, to prepare for it and time its arrival?
                        Will people overestimate or underestimate the passage of time? At what prelavence and why? Could the introduction or manipulation of uncertainty influence people's timing judgements and estimates? How would such behaviors differ from what we see in reactive experimental paradigms? You'll have to tune to find out !
